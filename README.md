# JavaScript Basics
This repository covers fundamental concepts of JavaScript, providing a solid foundation for any beginner to start their JavaScript journey.

## Arrays
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
- This section covers array basics and array methods.

## DOM (Document Object Model)
The DOM represents a webpage so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
- This section covers DOM manipulation techniques including selecting elements, changing styles, adding event listeners, handling form inputs, and modifying the DOM.

## Events
Events are actions that occur when the user interacts with the webpage.
- This section covers DOM events, form events, the `this` keyword, and more.

## Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks and can be called with different inputs. They help organize code and improve efficiency.
- This section covers function declarations, expressions, higher-order functions, and factory functions.
- Learn about scope, async functions, and more.

## Loops
Loops execute code repeatedly.
- This section covers `for`, `for...of`, `for...in`, and `while` loops.
- Learn to iterate over arrays, strings, nested arrays, and objects using practical examples to calculate totals and averages.

## Objects
Objects are collections of key-value pairs and are fundamental to JavaScript programming.
- This section covers declaring and initializing objects, using `const` with objects, accessing object properties using dot and bracket notation, working with numeric keys, and using variables to access properties.
- Additionally, it includes examples of nested arrays and objects, as well as accessing nested object properties.
- Learn how to create, manipulate, and traverse objects effectively.

## Operators
**Operators** are symbols used to perform operations on values and variables. They help in calculations and decision-making. This section includes:

### Arithmetic Operators
- **Addition (`+`)**
- **Subtraction (`-`)**
- **Multiplication (`*`)**
- **Division (`/`)**
- **Modulus (`%`)**

### Logical Operators
- **AND (`&&`)**: Checks if both conditions are true.
- **OR (`||`)**: Checks if at least one condition is true.
- **NOT (`!`)**: Checks if a condition is false.

## AJAX & APIs
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) has evolved into AJAJ (Asynchronous JavaScript and JSON).
- This section covers making HTTP requests using JSON, parsing JSON data, and interacting with web-based APIs.
- Learn how to convert JSON strings to JavaScript objects using `JSON.parse`, handle sample JSON data, and use reviver functions.
- Explore examples of using modern tools and techniques to efficiently share data between systems over the internet.

## Async
Asynchronous programming is essential for improving the performance and responsiveness of web applications.
- This section covers the use of `setTimeout`, Promises, async/await, and handling asynchronous operations.
- You'll learn how to manage the call stack, avoid callback hell, and chain Promises.
- Examples include functions for changing colors sequentially using Promises, handling fake HTTP requests with callbacks and Promises, and visualizing the call stack using tools like Chrome DevTools and Loupe.

## Classes
Classes are templates for creating objects in JavaScript.
- This section explains how to define and use classes with constructors, properties, and methods.
- You'll learn how to create instances of a class and use methods such as `rgb()`, `hex()`, `rgba()`, `hsl()`, `fullSaturation()`, and `opposite()`.
- The examples include converting colors between RGB, HEX, RGBA, and HSL formats, calculating HSL values, and styling HTML elements with these color instances.
- Explore how classes encapsulate functionality and make your code more modular and reusable.

## Extends & Super Keyword
The `extends` keyword is used to create a class that is a child of another class.
The `super` keyword is used to access properties and methods of the parent class.
- This section covers inheritance in JavaScript.

## Making HTTP Requests
Learn how to make HTTP requests using fetch, axios, and XML API methods to interact with web servers.

## setTimeout & setInterval
These functions are used to execute code after a set period or repeatedly at specified intervals.
- This section covers how to use them effectively.

## Truthy & Falsy Values
Understanding truthy and falsy values is crucial for writing accurate conditional statements.
- This section explains what values are considered truthy or falsy in JavaScript.

## try & catch
Error handling is an essential part of programming.
- Learn how to handle errors using `try` and `catch` blocks.

## Variables & Data Types
Variables store data values and are declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`. Data types determine the kind of data a variable can hold.
- This section includes files on declaring variables, primitive data types, and type conversion.
